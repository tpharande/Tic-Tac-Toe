# Tic-Tac-Toe
I developed an android Tic Tac Toe game using Android Studio. The game starts out with a login screen where you can either register for a new account or log in to one previously made. Once you login, you are taken to the main menu screen where you can select between the Start Game, Profile, Setting, or Logout button. The Start Game button will take you to the game menu. The premise of the game is to get to get 3 of the same colored ducks in a row. It is a two player game and one player will go after another until someone wins. Then, the game will reset to start a new game. The Profile button will take you to your profile where you can see any given information when you registered. Below that there is stats on the amount of games you won and your level. Additionally, there are two buttons where you can either change your profile information or change your password. The Settings button will take you to the settings menu where you can change the color of your duck. And finally, the Logout button will log you out of your account.
